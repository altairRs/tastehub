## What Was Done:

**Asem:**
- **Homepage:** Created the homepage of the platform with a general description. This serves as the starting point for users and provides information about the platform's features.
- **Recipe List Page:** Implemented a page where various recipes are displayed. Each recipe includes a brief description, allowing users to quickly view available dishes.

**Anuar:**
- **Recipe Detail Page:** Developed a page with detailed information about a specific recipe. Users can view ingredients, cooking instructions, and other important information.
- **Add Recipe Page:** Created a form for adding new recipes, allowing users to input recipe details such as name, ingredients, and instructions.

**Maxim:**
- **Registration/Login Page:** Implemented pages for user registration and login. Users can create a new account or log into an existing one.
- **Personal Dashboard:** Created a personal dashboard where users can view and edit their recipes. Personal information, ratings, and other data are also displayed.

## Final Updates
During the project, a unified style was applied to all pages. Previously, the pages had different styles, which created inconsistency and discomfort in the user interface. Now, all pages are styled uniformly, providing a consistent and professional appearance throughout the project.

What Was Done:
1. Temirbay Assem:
   Image Styling: Assem added rounded corners to images on both the homepage and the recipe page, improving the visual consistency and user experience.
   CSS Unification: She merged the styles for the homepage and recipe pages into a unified external CSS file for better code management and consistency.
2. Sultanbekov Anuar:
   Recipe Page Enhancements: Anuar merged all recipe-related styles into a single CSS file. He also applied rounded corners to images on the recipe detail page.
   Recipe Creation Improvements: He enhanced the recipe creation page by adding functionality for users to upload images when submitting a recipe and removed unnecessary code for a cleaner implementation.
3. Li Maxim:
   CSS Consolidation: Maxim combined all scattered styles into one unified CSS file, ensuring that the website has a consistent design across all pages. This helped to improve the maintainability and structure of the project.
   Final Result:
   We maintained a cohesive and consistent design by transferring all inline and internal styles into one external CSS file. This unification has streamlined the code, reduced duplication, and provided a cleaner, more professional appearance across the website. The external CSS file now manages all visual elements, making future updates easier and more efficient.
